"""Inspect, snapshot, restore, and re-point a local account save.

The server retains the last committed states beside the save, but retaining
them is only half of a recovery story: this is the half a player actually uses.
Every command here refuses to touch a save a server still holds, and every
destructive one preserves the current file first.

`adopt` exists because an account is keyed by the client's device UUID. Clearing
the app's data or reinstalling gives the client a new UUID, so its login no
longer matches and it signs up into a new, empty account while the real save
sits in the same file, complete and unreachable. Re-pointing it is a local
bookkeeping change, not a protocol one.

`link` is the two-device version of the same bookkeeping: instead of moving the
save onto a new UUID, it records the second device's UUID as an alias of an
existing account, so both devices sign in to one save. The wire protocol has no
account system at all — the silently stored device UUID is the only credential —
so this operator command is where "log in to my account from another device"
lives. `unlink` detaches the device again.

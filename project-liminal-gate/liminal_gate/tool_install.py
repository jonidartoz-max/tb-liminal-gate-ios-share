"""Fetch the external tools guided setup needs, into ignored local storage.

Nothing here is a Terra Battle asset.  Every download is a general-purpose
development tool published by its own vendor -- a JDK from Adoptium, the Android
command line tools and NDK from Google, the .NET runtime from Microsoft,
Il2CppDumper from its GitHub release -- and each lands beneath the tester's
ignored data directory rather than anywhere Git can see.  The project's own
inputs are still supplied by the operator and are still never downloaded.

Two pinning strategies are used, deliberately:

* Google's command line tools, the side-by-side NDK package, and Il2CppDumper
  are pinned to an exact build. Direct-archive checksums are written here;
  `sdkmanager` resolves and verifies the NDK through Google's repository
  metadata. These are versioned artefacts whose contents this project reasons
  about -- the dumper's version is already named in `tester_setup`, whose
  workaround for its exit behaviour is specific to it -- so a silent upgrade
  is a change worth refusing.
* The JDK and the .NET runtime are resolved through their vendor's own release
  API, and the checksum is the one that API publishes over the same HTTPS
  connection.  Both ship security updates on their own schedule, both are
  interchangeable within a major version, and pinning a patch release here
  would mean shipping a knowingly outdated runtime between releases.

A checksum from a vendor API is weaker than one reviewed in source: it attests
that the bytes are the ones the vendor's own index names, not that anyone here
has seen them.  It is recorded as such rather than presented as a stronger
guarantee than it is.

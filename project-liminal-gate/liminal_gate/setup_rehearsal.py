"""Rehearse guided setup end to end and compare the result with a known-good run.

Guided setup is the one path every operator takes and the one path the unit
suite cannot reach: `tests/test_tester_setup.py` proves the decisions setup
makes, with the IL2CPP dump, the master-data import, the catalog derivations,
the APK patch, and the signing all replaced by fakes.  Proving the real pipeline
still works has meant resetting a checkout by hand, running setup, and reading
the output -- which is slow enough that it happens rarely and by eye, so a
catalog that quietly lost half its rows looks exactly like one that did not.

This module turns that manual rehearsal into one command.  It stages a clean
copy of the source, builds an isolated environment, runs guided setup against
the operator's own immutable inputs, then starts the server the same way setup
would and drives a real onboarding sequence over HTTP through a restart.  What
it produces is a summary of facts -- input hashes, generated-artifact hashes,
catalog row counts, and the transport result -- which is compared field by field
against a stored baseline.  A regression therefore reports itself as a named
changed field rather than as something the operator has to notice.

The baseline is derived from the operator's own APK and resource tree, so it is
never committed: it lives beside the save, under `--data-dir`, and a run refuses
to compare against a baseline recorded from different inputs.

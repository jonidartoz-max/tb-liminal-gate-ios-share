"""Daily Quest stage identities and bounded local settlement.

Three different evidence grades live in this file and are labeled row by row.

**Recovered.** The stage set itself. ``DailyQuestData.questOrder`` in the
operator's own APK names fourteen stages, Chapters 6000--6012 plus section 2 of
6011; see :mod:`liminal_gate.daily_quest_importer`. A real BattleData tree
carries exactly those fourteen rows and no others, and the resource tree carries
exactly those fourteen ``Banner/sp<chapter>-<section>`` bundles. Three
independent assets agree on the same set.

**Confirmed identity.** Which stage is which quest. Each of the fourteen banner
textures in the APK was matched pixel-wise against the community record's own
banner images; every one matched a distinct quest, eleven of them essentially
identically, with the nearest rival roughly fifty times further away in every
case. Three of the assignments were independently predicted before the match
and confirmed by it: 6006 is the Energy quest because the client's own
``DailyQuestManager.EnergyGetChapter`` says so, 6011 carries the two Yamamoto
variants because it is the only chapter with two sections, and the rotation's
frequency classes force 6010 once 6006 is fixed.

**Recovered.** Which Companion each Puzzle Quest may drop. 6011-1 and 6011-2
are the only two Daily Quests whose ``BattleData`` section declares a
``dropBuddies`` manifest at all; see ``_YAMAMOTO_COMPANIONS``.

**Local policy from a secondary source.** The settlement bounds. The retired
service owned Daily Quest rewards and the client only rendered them, so no
single APK table gives them and none can be recovered whole. The ceilings below
bound a client-reported clear the way the Hunting families do; they are
deliberately generous, because their job is to refuse an absurd claim rather
than to reproduce a drop rate. Item identities come from the community record
and were resolved to IDs through the operator's own master data, which is what
makes them checkable: ``Energy`` resolves to 80, the same number the client's
own ``DailyQuestManager.EnergyItemId`` carries, and the two tickets resolve to
the 50 and 81 this project already uses elsewhere.

A bound here is only ever too generous safely, never too tight. A refused clear
is not a refused reward: it leaves the account's battle active, which blocks
every other stage until that same quest is replayed and accepted, so a ceiling
that a real clear can cross reads to the player as a corrupted installation.
Every ceiling widened in this file was widened for that reason.

The Hunt For Joker grants **character 1018, Joker Λ**, which is neither an item
nor a Companion and so travels through a dedicated server-side grant rather than
the reported-drop channel. Its identity is resolved from the operator's own
master data. The community record puts the drop at 100% and a further recruit at
+10% Skill Boost and +10 Luck; those two increments are the same grade of
secondary-source policy as the ceilings.

Every Daily Quest pays out **once per UTC day**, the boundary the record gives
for the rotation switching over. The client greys a played quest out from the
``lastDailyQuestPlayTime`` fields the login response carries, and the same limit
is enforced server-side as well, so a client that asks anyway is refused with
the client's own soft refusal rather than an error.

**Which two quests are today's is the server's answer, not the client's.**
``DailyQuestManager`` holds ``todaysQuest``/``todaysQuest1``/``todaysQuest2`` and
fills them from the login response's ``dailyQuest``/``dailyQuest1``/
``dailyQuest2``; ``IsDailyQuestPlayable1``/``2`` gate entry on those strings.
Sending the category flag without them leaves the menu drawn and every entry
greyed out, which is the shape of the defect this rotation exists to fix.

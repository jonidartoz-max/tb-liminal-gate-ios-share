"""Which rewards a Luck Treasure Chest may hold, per stage and tier.

**Community record, and incomplete by its own admission.** The retired service
authored chest contents and the client only rendered them, so no table exists in
the APK to recover. What exists is the final wiki's per-stage reward lists,
scraped with page and revision provenance. Every row of that scrape carries
`community_table_incomplete`, and the wiki says so itself.

Two consequences are deliberate and should not be quietly fixed later:

* **Only thirty story stages have a pool at all.** Every other stage in the game
  has none, and a stage with no pool yields no chest rather than a guessed one.
  This is a floor on what the feature does, not a claim that other stages had no
  chests -- almost certainly they did, and the record simply does not cover them.
* **Ninety-nine scraped rewards were dropped as unresolvable**, and twenty-eight
  of the thirty stages below lost at least one. Sixty-eight were character icons
  the scrape could not resolve to an ID, four were item names that resolved to
  nothing, and twenty-seven were empty or generic cells. Character rewards are
  therefore almost entirely absent from these pools even though the record shows
  chests award them. Resolving those icons against the operator's own master
  data is the obvious next improvement.

Rewards are wire-encoded the way the client reads a slot: `C` and an amount for
Coins, `I` and an item ID, `O` and a Companion ID. `M` and a character ID is the
fourth form the client accepts and no pool here uses it, for the reason above.

Selection within a tier is equal-weight, because the record carries no weights:
the scrape has no such column, and inventing one would be inventing the drop
rate this project refuses to invent. See `luck_data` for the appearance odds,
whose endpoints *are* sourced.

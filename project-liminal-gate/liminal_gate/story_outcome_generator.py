"""Compose a local story-outcome catalog from the user's own recovered drops.

``--story-outcome-catalog`` is the option that lets a story clear mint a
Companion.  Without one, ``clear_quest`` writes no ``buddyInfo`` at all, so a
self-hosted instance can play the whole story and never see a Companion drop
even though the client rolled one.  Authoring that catalog by hand means
writing a per-stage Companion ceiling for every ordinary stage, which nobody
will do.  This composes it from data the user already has.

Two sources, unioned
--------------------

1. ``BattleData.Section.dropBuddies`` -- the curated per-section allowlist the
   client itself carries.  Each entry packs one Companion and its per-clear cap
   into a single integer (``code >> 8`` is the Companion, ``code & 0xFF`` the
   cap).  Read straight out of the reviewed APK.
2. The native encounter map from :mod:`liminal_gate.native_encounter_importer`,
   joined to ``EnemyData``.  Each spawn resolves to an enemy record, and that
   record's ``DropBuddyID``/``DropBuddyRatio`` say which Companion that enemy
   can drop.  A stage's ceiling for a Companion is then simply how many enemies
   able to drop it the stage spawns.

Neither source subsumes the other.  The section allowlist covers stages the
native map cannot resolve; the native map covers Companions the section list
omits.  The ceiling taken is the larger of the two, which is what a ceiling
means: it permits a roll the client legitimately made and invents nothing.

Item and character ceilings
---------------------------

``StoryOutcomeRule`` also carries ``item_maxima`` and ``character_maxima``, and
an empty ceiling *forbids* the outcome rather than permitting it.  Both are
therefore derived here rather than left empty, from the same per-enemy records
the Companion ceiling already reads:

* **Items** come from ``EnemyParams.items``, a four-slot ``ItemCode`` array in
  which ``code >> 8`` is the item and ``code & 0xFF`` the count.  845 of the
  recovered enemy records carry at least one.  There is no per-item ratio, so
  every item an enemy names contributes a ceiling.
* **Characters** come from ``EnemyParams.DropJobID``, which names a
  ``ChrJobParams`` row whose ``chrID`` is the character the client actually
  recruits -- the monster drop ``AddDropMon`` records.  A zero ``DropRatio``
  never rolls and contributes nothing, matching how the Companion ceiling reads
  its own ratio.

A stage the native map cannot join still has no item or character evidence, and
its ceilings stay empty.  The run report counts those stages so an operator
opting into strict validation can see exactly where a clear reporting an item or
a recruited monster would be refused, and ``--baseline`` carries an
operator-authored catalog through unchanged while the recovered ceilings are
unioned on top.

Inferred variants
-----------------

A chapter program may spawn a *variant* initializer -- a base enemy with a
behavioural modifier -- which resolves to the base enemy's record with
``exact: false`` in the encounter import.  Those rows are Strongly inferred, not
Confirmed, and are never relabelled here: the summary counts the stages whose
ceiling depends on one, and ``--exact-only`` drops them entirely.

Usage::

    python3 -m liminal_gate.story_outcome_generator \\
        --apk local-input/terra-battle-5.5.7-170.apk \\
        --dummy-dll-dir /path/to/il2cpp-output/DummyDll \\
        --native-encounters user-data/derived/native-encounters.json \\
        --character-catalog user-data/character-catalog.json \\
        --output user-data/derived/story-outcomes.json

The result is validated by ``load_story_outcome_catalog`` before it is written,
so a catalog this produces either loads or says why it does not.

"""Recovered Battle Summon skill-unlock costs from the final client.

`SummonData` names the `ChrJobParams` job row backing each Summon's skill tier;
this table is that join, carrying each tier's Coin cost and material list.

Version 5.5.0 discontinued Eidolon enhancement and in-battle use with Co-op/VS.
The route and table remain in the final binary as archival compatibility
evidence; they are not a required or proven reachable final-version solo loop.

Every one of the sixteen Summons has a level 0 that costs nothing and requires
no materials -- the skill the Summon ships with. Summons 1 and 2 have only that
level; the other fourteen each have two paid tiers above it, so there are 44
rows in total. All main-story Summon skill unlocks cost zero Coins and are paid
for in materials alone, which is the client's own arrangement.

Each row is ``(summon_id, skill_level, coins, ((item_id, count), ...))``.
Material item IDs are decoded `ItemCode` values (``code >> 8`` is the item,
``code & 0xFF`` the count).

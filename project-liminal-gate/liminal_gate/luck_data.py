"""Luck: the stat, its caps, team averaging, and Luck Treasure Chest odds.

Luck is a per-character stat the client stores in tenths and displays divided by
ten -- `Character.get_luckRate` (ARM64 `0xD08B74`) loads the float at
`0x2056F48`, which is `0.1`, and multiplies by the stored value. Its only
purpose is Luck Treasure Chests: the retired service rolled six chest slots at
battle start, sent them as `luckResult` on `start_quest`, and the client
rendered them at the results screen. The client holds no chest table and no
spawn rule of its own, so nothing here can be recovered from the APK.

Three evidence grades are labeled below.

**Confirmed, primary.** Mistwalker's own Ver 4.2.0 announcement (2016-08-26,
archived) states the per-class caps, that a chest's "spawn rate and contents
depend on your team's average Luck value", that some quests spawn no chest at
all, and that Luck never increases from a quest costing less than eight
stamina.

**Community record.** The final wiki's Luck page supplies the six chest tiers
and four probability anchors, the 0.1--0.3 gain range, and the Companion
effects -- which independently corroborate the three Companion Luck constants
this server already derives from the operator's own APK, naming Unicorn (+10
personal), Panda (+30 personal), Senala O (+10 team), six Companions at +5
team, and Royal Ringstone doubling a gain.

**Local policy.** Exactly one thing: the *shape* of the curve between anchors.
Every endpoint below is sourced; only the interpolation joining them is chosen,
and it is chosen to add no free parameters -- each tier rises in proportion to
team Luck until it reaches the value the record states, and stays there. A
curve with invented coefficients was deliberately not used.

Note that `allowLucky` in the client's own `BattleData` is *not* the chest gate,
though it reads like one; see `docs/findings.md`, 2026-08-02.

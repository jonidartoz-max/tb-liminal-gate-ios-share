"""Author a battle's six chest slots and its Luck growth, replay-stably.

The retired service decided both at battle start and sent them on
`start_quest`; the client rendered the chests at the results screen and folded
their contents into the balances it reports back at clear. Nothing about either
decision is recoverable from the APK, so this module is where the sourced
anchors in `luck_data` and the documented pools in `luck_pool_data` become an
actual roll.

**Replay is handled by construction, not by storage.** Both rolls are seeded
from the request identity, so a client retrying the same start -- under the same
request ID or a fresh one -- receives byte-identical chests rather than a
re-roll. That matters more here than elsewhere: a re-roll on retry would be a
reward duplicator.

One number in this module is invented, and it is isolated here rather than
spread through the logic: the chance a character gains Luck at a given stamina
cost. No source states it. What the sources do fix are its boundaries -- the
gate below eight stamina is Mistwalker's own, and the 0.1--0.3 magnitude is the
community record's -- so only the slope between them is chosen.

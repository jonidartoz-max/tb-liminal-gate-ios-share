"""The client's stamina meter, recovered from the final 5.5.7 ARM64 binary.

Stamina and Energy are two different currencies and the server must not
confuse them.  Energy (``energy``/``freeEnergy``/``energyAppStore``/...) is the
premium wallet spent on Pacts, job unlocks and stamina refills.  Stamina is a
time-refilling meter that quest entry consumes, and it is *not* stored as a
balance at all -- the client derives it from one Unix-seconds fill origin,
``UserData.refillStartTime`` (ARM64 field offset ``0x40``).

``GameManager.CalcStamina`` (ARM64 ``0xD9CFC0-0xD9D150``) is the whole model:

    elapsed   = max(0, now - refillStartTime)
    filled    = elapsed / ServerConstants.refillInterval        # integer div
    nextInSec = refillInterval - elapsed % refillInterval       # UI countdown
    stamina   = min(filled, GetMaxStamina()) + UserData.bonusStamina

A zero origin therefore reads as a full meter, because ``now - 0`` is a very
large elapsed time that the ``min`` clamps to the maximum.  That is why a
server which always answers ``refillStartTime: 0.0`` shows a bar that never
moves however many quests are entered -- the value is not a placeholder the
client ignores, it is an assertion that the meter refilled at the epoch.

``UserData.GetMaxStamina`` (ARM64 ``0x19D8BDC-0x19D8D60``) is a two-branch
single-precision curve on the account's current chapter, scaled by a percentage
bias:

    ch <= 30:  trunc((ch - 1)  / 29.0f * 80.0f + 20.0f)
    ch >  30:  trunc((ch - 30) / 30.0f * 80.0f + 100.0f)
    result  =  MaxStaminaBias * that / 100

The two ``80.0f``/``100.0f`` operands are code constants read from ``0x204F418``
and ``0x204F1FC``.  The arithmetic is genuinely ``float``, not ``double`` and
not integer, so it is reproduced here at single precision rather than
simplified -- a rounded rewrite would disagree with the client's own bar.

A version gate in front of the curve clamps the chapter to
``ServerConstants.maxChapter`` only when the running client is older than
``2.6``; the final client is ``5.5.7``, so that branch is never taken and no
clamp applies.

``ServerConstants.MaxStaminaBias`` is not sent by this server, and it does not
have to be: ``SetServerConstants`` writes a literal ``100`` when the key is
absent (ARM64 ``0x19D57AC``).  The constant below is that default, so the two
agree without adding a key whose production value was never recovered.

Confidence: Confirmed.  Every constant and branch above was read from the
shipped ARM64 ``libil2cpp.so``; none of it is inferred from secondary sources.

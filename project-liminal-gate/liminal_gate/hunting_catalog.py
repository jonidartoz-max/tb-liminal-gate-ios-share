"""Validate a user-local Hunting stage catalog.

Hunting battles are executed entirely by the client.  The server's whole job is
to authorise an entry, charge its cost, and accept a settlement that stays
inside bounds the operator declared -- so this catalog carries stage identity,
entry cost, unlock policy, and result ceilings, and deliberately carries no
enemy, encounter, reward, or resource data.

A stage may come from an operator's own catalog file, or from the bundled
policy below, which follows the same split the Pact and core-story policies
already use: recovered structure and observed costs are bundled, while anything
that would be a claim about the retired service's tuning -- odds, rotations,
schedules -- is an explicit local policy instead.

# Time, Crystal Road, Lucky Orbling and Eidolon Forest -- which tracks the
# "Lucky"-type enemies that grant Luck when pincered, not chests; Crystal Road
# carries `allowLucky` 1 while the record lists it as having no chest at all.

# edited while the final version was live) documents three to five of one
# random Star per defeated machine, so Chapter 1201 accepts the four recovered
# Star IDs under a generous local ceiling: the bound is inert if the client
# never rolls an item there, and it stops a won battle being refused if it
# does.  The record's Messages-borne Mech Skill Drop has no recovered item
# identity or transport and stays out.  None of the three flags addresses

# Dragon -- a 25% spawn whose defeat recruits it -- so Chapter 1200 accepts at

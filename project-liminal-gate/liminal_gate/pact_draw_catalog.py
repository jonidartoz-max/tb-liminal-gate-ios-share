# record's provenance is now dated: Mistwalker began displaying recruitment
# rates in-game on 2018-02-28 (archived official news, "Display of
# Character/Companion recruitment rates", 2018-02-23; Wayback capture
# 20180228133231 of terra-battle.com/en/news/2018/02/post-156.html), and the
# community wiki's Pact of Truth page transcribes the displayed split as
# exactly these 4/10/15/71 shares.  Two things the display had that this table
# does not: per-character rates, and a pool that shrank as characters hit 100%
# Skill Boost and left it, redistributing their share.  Within a class the
# share is split evenly, which is what the source describes for A/B and the
# only defensible reading for the rest.  Fellowship keeps uniform selection
# because no comparable record of its rates was found -- the only surviving
# empirical data, a 2015 forum sample of ~1,200 pulls (Wayback capture
# 20150424040406 of terrabattleforum.com thread 5198), predates the final
# pool, though its uniform spread across the six adventurers supports uniform
# selection within a class.  Inventing a class table from a 2015 sample would

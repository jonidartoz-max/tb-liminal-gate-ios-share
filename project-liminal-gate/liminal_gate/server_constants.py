"""The `constants` object the final client reads from the server-status route.

The client does not merely display these values -- several of its screens are
*gated* on them, and one of those gates is why Huntland looked permanently
locked while the server-side policy was already enabled:

- `UIIconBtn.Update` (ARM64 `0xE942B8-0xE94314`) disables all four Huntland
  cards unless `UserData.IsFinalMajorUpdated()` is true, and that predicate
  (`0x19D75D4-0x19D7680`) requires both `currentVersion_iOS` and
  `currentVersion_Android` to exceed `4.99`.  This is independent of story
  progress, event flags, and `metalZoneUnlockTime`.
- `UISpecialSelect` mode 6 reads `metalHuntingList` and mode 7 reads
  `huntingHuntingList`.  The final APK hard-codes no per-zone thresholds, so
  the server is the only authority for which zones exist.

Two consequences shape this module.  The block is served whole rather than in
part, because the client's setter indexes the opening economy keys directly.
And the country arrays are not optional once the version gate passes: the same
final-major branch in `UITitle.<_Login>.MoveNext` (`0xF411C4`) dereferences
`CountryCodes` and `NoServiceCountryCodes` immediately, and reaches
`ShowSelectUserCountry` -- which consumes `CountriesJa` or `CountriesEn` -- when
no country is stored.  Supplying the version without the arrays turns a locked
card into a title-login `NullReferenceException`.

Recovered values are labeled Confirmed in `docs/findings.md`.  The country
roster is not recovered and is an explicitly local compatibility fixture.

    The two Pact costs are parameters because sending them makes the client

"""Report which build tools this machine has, and optionally fetch the rest.

This answers the question `docs/install-tools.md` used to answer with three
pages of per-shell `export` lines: *is this machine ready, and if not, what
would make it ready*.  Run with `--install-missing` it also does the fetching,
into the ignored data directory, and records where everything landed so no
shell variable has to be set in this terminal or any later one.

What it deliberately does not do:

* touch a shell profile, the registry, or anything outside `--data-dir`;
* accept Google's SDK licences without being told to;
* download Android Studio, an emulator system image, or any game material.

The tester still supplies their own APK and resources, and still needs a device
or emulator to install onto.  This command is about the toolchain around that,
which is the part that can be automated honestly.

"""Preservation-mode Energy income for a service that no longer sells it.

The retired service supplied Energy three ways this archive cannot reproduce:
in-app purchase, timed campaign gifts, and operator compensation mail.  Nothing
in the final client mints Energy on its own -- ``ChapterClearEnergyBonus`` and
``EnergyBonusByDailyQuest`` are display strings the server's own response is
expected to back with a real balance.  A local server that grants none therefore
leaves an account permanently poorer than it started, because Pacts, job
unlocks, Metal Zone openings and stamina refills all debit the same wallet with
no path back to it.

This module is the replacement income, and it is stated plainly as **local
preservation policy, not recovered service behaviour**.  The original per-stage
award, if any existed, was never captured; these rates are chosen to be small,
transparent and replay-safe, and they match the private reference server so the
two economies stay interchangeable while it is retired.

Two grants:

- Every unique stage pays ``FIRST_CLEAR_FREE_ENERGY`` the first time it is
  cleared and ``REPEAT_CLEAR_FREE_ENERGY`` on every later clear.  The
  first-clear half is guarded by a per-account key set rather than by request
  identity, so replaying an old clear under a fresh request id cannot farm it.
- Completing a chapter pays ``CHAPTER_CLEAR_FREE_ENERGY`` once, ever, tracked
  by chapter number.

Both are capped at ``MAX_FREE_ENERGY``, which *is* recovered: it is the
``maxFreeEnergy`` this server already advertises in its constants block.
